# Project Title: Basic Calculator

## Description
A simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

## Objectives
- Learn to handle user input in Python.
- Implement basic arithmetic operations.
- Understand conditional statements and loops in Python.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3.x

## How to Run/View the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Python file `calculator.py`.
3. Follow the prompts to enter two numbers and choose an operation.

## Insights/Reflections
- Learned how to handle user input and conditional statements.
- Encountered challenges with validating user input, which was solved using `try` and `except`.
